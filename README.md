### ⚡ **Performance Testing**
- Real-world read/write speed measurement
- Memory-optimized streaming for large files
- Progress tracking with ETA calculations
- Configurable file sizes (1MB to 10GB)

### � **Duplicate File Management**
- Multiple selection modes (oldest/newest/alphabetical)
- Flexible actions (delete/move duplicates)

- Hash caching for faster repeated scans
- Support for saving/loading duplicate lists

### �🛡️ **Security Features**
- High-speed secure data wiping to prevent recovery (4.7+ GB/s)

## 🔍 Advanced Features

### Batch Processing
Create `commands.txt`:
```text
# Multiple device check
device C: info
device D: test del
device E: speed 100
folder C:\temp clean
```

Run: `filedo from commands.txt`

### History Tracking
```bash
filedo hist              # Show last 10 operations
filedo history           # Show command history
# History automatically logged for all operations
```

### Interruption Support
```bash
# All long-running operations support Ctrl+C interruption
# Graceful cancellation with cleanup
# Context-aware interruption at optimal points
```

### Network Operations
```bash
# SMB shares and network drives
filedo \\server\backup speed 100
filedo \\nas\storage test del
filedo network \\pc\share info
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

> **🎯 Fake Capacity Detection**: Creates 100 files (1% capacity each) with **context-aware interruption support**. Uses modern random verification patterns and optimized buffer management for reliable detection.

> **🔥 Enhanced Interruption**: All long-running operations support **Ctrl+C graceful cancellation** with automatic cleanup. Context-aware interruption checks at optimal points for immediate responsiveness.

> **�️ Secure Wiping**: `fill <size> del` overwrites free space with optimized buffer management and context-aware writing for secure data deletion.

> **🟢 Test Files**: Creates `FILL_*.tmp` and `speedtest_*.txt` files. Use `clean` command to remove them automatically.

> **🔵 Modular Architecture**: Refactored with separate `capacitytest` and `fileduplicates` packages for better maintainability and extensibility.
